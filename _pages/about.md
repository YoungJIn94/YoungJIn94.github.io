I am a PhD student at Seoul National University's [Optical Engineering and Quantum Electronics Lab](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/), previously led by the late [Byoungho Lee](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF) and currently by [Yoonchan Jeong](https://laser.snu.ac.kr/members/professor). My research interest focuses on the computational design of metasurface-integrated optical systems for imaging devices, holographic displays, and AR/VR.

Personally, I love to travel, especially my year-long trip to Berlin, which is a very precious memory for me. I love to play and watch soccer (frenkie de jong, what a player!).
