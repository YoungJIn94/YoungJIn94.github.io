I am currently working with Professor [Mark Brongersma](https://brongersma.stanford.edu/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University. 

I aim to develop [next-generation imaging and display systems leveraging nanophotonics]() empowered by computational optics design frameworks.

My research tackles the physical limitations of current optical vision systems, which are essential for applications like robotics and AR/VR systems. I'm developing innovative sensing devices that leverage nanophotonics, particularly metasurfaces, to push the boundaries of hardware, enabling the capture of higher-quality visual information that can be synergistically processed by next-generation AI for enhanced visual intelligence.

I completed my BS and PhD in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Seoul National University, where I worked with the late Professor [Byoungho Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VExwDP4AAAAJ) and Professor [Yoonchan Jeong](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROFJ).
