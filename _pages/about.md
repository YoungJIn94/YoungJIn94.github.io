I am a PhD student at the [Optical Engineering and Quantum Electronics Lab](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University. The lab was previously led by the late [Byoungho Lee](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF) and is now directed by [Yoonchan Jeong](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROFJ). My research focuses on developing metasurfaces and nanophotonic devices. Specifically, I am passionate about leveraging computational design to innovate metasurface-integrated optical systems, such as cameras, holographic displays, AR/VR systems, and microscopes. By employing differentiable optimization frameworks and machine learning techniques, I aim to drive advancements in these fields.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for travel. A particularly cherished memory is my year-long stay in Berlin, which remains close to my heart. I am also an avid soccer enthusiast, both as a player and a fanâ€”Frenkie de Jong, what a talent!
