I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Seoul National University. I completed my PhD with [Distinguished Dissertation Award]() in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Seoul National University, where I worked with the late Professor [Byoungho Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VExwDP4AAAAJ) and Professor [Yoonchan Jeong](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROFJ).

I aim to develop [innovative imaging and display systems leveraging nanophotonics](), particularly metasurfaces, for cameras, AR/VR systems, holographic displays, and microscopes through computational optics design frameworks.

Below are my key research experiences:
* Visiting Researcher, [Stanford University](https://brongersma.stanford.edu/) (Advisor: [Mark Brongersma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=llkveWIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)), CA, USA, Nov. 2023 ~ Feb. 2024.
* Research Scientist Intern, Meta Reality Labs (Advisor: Xiayu Feng), WA, USA, Jun. 2024 ~ Oct. 2024
